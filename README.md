# sinatra-project-movie-review

## Objectives

 Build a Sinatra application that uses:

 - MVC
 - RESTful routes
 - ActiveRecord(Models, Associations)
 - A sqlite database
 - Login/Logout
 
 ## Overview

 This project is building a simple Content Management System (CMS) using the tools we've learned so far.

 It can track the reviews of movies from users and user needs to sign up to see or wirte reviews. Once the user is logged in, they are able to create, edit and delete their own reviews but they will still able to see other user's posts.
